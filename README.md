# SymptomCheck
## About

SymptomCheck is a web app helping to identify potential urgent symptoms of diseases like heart disease, stroke and sepsis.
It started with detecting symptoms of sepsis and now turned into a generic app where admins can maintain diseases, their symptoms and their criticality.
The frontend will ask you a set of questions sorted by criticality and can provide guidance on how to act accordingly.
It is still in an early prototype stage, though. Much of it was written using AI to quickly see which ideas work and which don't.
